An example of the deterministic theory is classical mechanics. \n",
    " Theorems about the uniqueness of solutions for Newton equations  gave hope for total determinism and predictability of the motion of individual particles. This hope from a practical point of view turned out to be a dream. In the 1950s it was shown that from a practical point of view the determinism of Newton's mechanics is illusory and the established belief in the predictability of simple mechanical systems has collapsed. Numerous examples appeared, and later a mathematical theory, showing the impossibility of predicting the temporal evolution of simple mechanical systems. We emphasize that this is about practical aspects of predictability. From a mathematical point of view, predictability is still valid. A clear example of unpredictability in practice is the weather forecast, which proves everyday day. Below we will present issues that will show us what unpredictability means in deterministic theory. We will show why the evolution determined by the determinism of Newton's equations is unpredictable. This deterministic unpredictability has its name: deterministic chaos."

Usually we start with time and position scaling. We make the followin coice: The new dimensionless time $\\tau$ has the form:\n",

Phase curves are closed which means that the particle moves periodically over time.

    "It turns out that this system exhibits  radically different properties from the previous two cases. From the physics point of view, the particle moves in a bistable potential. Because the potential tends to infinity when the position tends to infinity, the movement of the particle is bounded; the particle is trapped in the potential and can not escape to infinity. The friction force pushes the particle to one of (\"old\") stationary states $x_{s1}$ or $x_{s2}$. In turn, the external periodic force pumps energy into the system and counteracts the friction force. The particle no longer tends to a time-independent  stationary state, it will not stop for long times but it will non-stop move and will never rest. The inertial effects associated with mass of the particls, which are reflected in the word $\\dot y$, i.e. acceleration of the particle, become significant.  As a consequence, the system does not have a stationary state in the form of a point in the phase space as it was in case 2. All these factors become essential for understanding the complex  properties of particle evolution."

The red and green colors are distinguishable in the upper right figure showing the evolution of $x(t)$ for short times. If we look at the regime of long times (the two lower diagrams), we will notice a deep similarity in evolution: the phase curves are closed so it is a simple periodic motion, resembling a slightly deformed $\\sin(\\alpha t)$ or $\\cos(\\alpha t)$ function. It is a periodic function with a characteristic one-only $T$ period. Therefore, we say that there is a periodic motion at period 1. The two curves on the lower right figure are not distinguishable.\n",

One could ask: what is the basin of attraction for this attractor? In order to answer this question, one should examine numerically, for example, the square of initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ and select those initial conditions that tend to r the above phase curve of period 1.

    "The initial evolution of two solutions is indistinguishable (because two initial conditions are very close to each other).

It should be noted that for long times many trajectories generated by different initial conditions behave very similarly, many trajectories are attracted. Here, too, there is an attractor and its basin of attraction. However, this attractor is strange: its dimension is not an integer and the attractor is a fractal. That's why it's called a strange attractor. \n",
