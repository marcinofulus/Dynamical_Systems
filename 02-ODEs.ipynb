    "In the case of an ideal (not damped) oscillator, the phase curves are closed and it means that the motion is periodic.  The period of such periodic motion is the time needed for the particle starting from a point e.g. $\\{x_0, y_0\\}$ and moving along a phase curve to reach the same point $\\{x_0, y_0\\}$ again.\n",
    "In the case of a damped oscillator, the phase curve is a spiral that winds up to $\\{0, 0\\}$. Spiral motion means that both $x$ and $v=y$ decrease over time and for long times the location of $x$ and the speed of $v$ go to zero, i.e. the particle slows down and finally stops. This is damped motion: the vibration amplitude decreases over time. One can observe more  complex phase curves but  the general rule is: when $x$ grows, it means the particle's position increases. When $y$ decreases, it means that the particle velocity decreases. When $x$ decreases, the position coordinate of the particle decreases. As $y$ increases, the particle velocity increases."
