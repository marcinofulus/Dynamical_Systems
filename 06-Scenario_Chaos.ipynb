    "# Period Doubling Bifurcation Route to Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing the parameters of the system and initial conditions, we can control time evolution of the system. We have seen that in the previously analyzed system, there are periodic solutions. Periodic solutions can have a simple structure characterized by one characteristic period T (or frequency). There are also more complicated periodic solutions:  with periods  2, 3, 4, etc. Note that the periodic motion of period 3 is repeated after 3 times longer than the period 1 movement. Therefore, the regularity of movement can be observed after 3 times longer.  The period-20 solutions are  repeated after a time 20 times longer than the period-1 solutions.  Therefore, the regularity of movement is observed after  time 20 times longer. Periodic movement with a period of 2000 is repeated after a time of 2000 times longer than that of period 1. Therefore, the regularity of motion  can be observed after a time of 200 times longer. By increasing the periodicity of movement to infinity, we notice that the regularity of movement repeats after an infinite time, i.e. the movement becomes irregular for  the observer. The trajectory looks as if it is random, chaotic. The motion is still deterministic, but complicated, erratic,  irregular. In some cases, the system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions: for two different, but very little different initial conditions, the corresponding trajectories diverge from one another after some characteristic time. If we reduce the distance between the initial conditions, then the time after which you can distinguish between 2 trajectories is longer, but sooner or later, the trajectories begin to diverge. From a practical point of view, initial conditions can be given with finite accuracy, but not with zero accuracy, as assumed in mathematical theorems. Therefore, in a regime in which the system is sensitive to initial conditions, in practice the uncertainty of initial conditions causes uncertainty of time evolution. This can be formulated in the mathematical sense in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x(t)$ be the trajectory with the initial condition $x(0)$, and $X(t)$ is e the trajectory with the initial condition $X(0)$. Let two initial conditions differ by a small amount:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|X(0) - x(0)| = \\epsilon_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $| ... |$ means the distance with respect to a prescribed metrix.  Ley us say that:  If they differ by such a size or smaller, then they are indistinguishable to us; we treat them as the same one trajectory within the measurement error. We ask what the difference is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|X(t) - x(t)| = \\epsilon(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "after time $t$ due to the uncertainty of initial condition $\\epsilon_0$. Sensitivity to initial conditions means that 2 trajectories move away from each other at a very fast, exponential rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0  \\mbox{e}^{\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "\n",

We can increase the network of measuring points, and weather prediction is only reasonable for a few days ahead.\n",

    "## Route to chaos: period doubling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now present a standard scenario of the transition to chaos, which is called the route  to chaos by period doubling. It is a universal scenario, occurring both in systems with continuous time and in discrete systems. It has been confirmed in many experiments with  a variety of physical systems. It is based on the same idea presented below.  This scenario is regular: bifurcations occur that change the periodicity of periodic orbits. The period 1 orbit (i.e., the  period is the same as the external time periodic force) bifurcates into the orbit of period 2 if we change, for example, the amplitude  $A$ of the driving external force. The period 2 orbit is bifurcated into the orbit of period 4, which in turn bifurcates into the orbit of period 8. This scenario is repeated when the amplitude  $A$ changes. In the case shown in the figures below, the amplitude bifurcation values are (these are not exact but approximated values):\n",

    "## Lyapunov exponents\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Duffing oscillator driven by the time-periodic force, the phase space is 3-dimensional. Therefore in fact there are 3 Lyapunov exponents.  To explain this problem, we need to consider the set of initial conditions that form e.g. a ball $K$  in the 3-dimensional phase space. There are 3 axes and radiuses into the direction of three axes have the same value, say $R_1=R_2=R_3$.   If we start to iterate equations for $x(t), y(t), z(t)$ starting from all initial points of the ball $K$, then the set of points contained initially in the ball  will change its shape. The ball  will no longer be a ball. The  ball is deformed in all three directions of $(x, y, z)$ in the phase space and the shape is  determined by the three Lyapunov exponents $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$. If the  system is chaotic, then the ball deformes in such a way that $R_1$ increases in one direction  and $R_2$ decreases in the other one, taking the shape of e.g. an ellipsoid. In this case, we can define three Lyapunov exponents measuring the deformations of the ellipsoid in three mutually perpendicular directions. The number of Lyapunov exponents is therefore dependent on the dimension of phase space of the system. They signs are   one of the criteria of chaotic  motion: \n",
    "\n",

In the chaotic regime, at least one of the Lyapunov exponents is positive. This means that in the phase space trajectories diverge in one direction. If all three exponents are negative, the system is in regular (regular, quasi-periodic). There are no analytical methods to calculate the Lapunov exponents. Numeric methods are also not simple.

    "## Power spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another quantity that can be an indicator of chaotic behavior of the deterministic system. The notion of power spectrum is well established in the theory of signals, treated as an information carrier. In general, signals can be deterministic (as in our case) and random (stochastic). In the engineering sense, the signal is any function of time. Signals which are represented by distributions (generalized functions) are lso considered.   Only few simple signals can be described by mathematical formulas. Most of the signals we encounter in practice are so complex and irregular that their direct description as a function of time is troublesome. Therefore, you should use their different representations. The representation of the signal is a kind of symbolic description, sometimes with a significant degree of abstraction. Its essence is that it contains full information about the signal, although usually expressed in a different language than the direct language in terms of the time function. This means that knowing the signal, we can clearly determine its representation, and knowing this representation - reproduce the signal. There are many ways to represent signals. One of them is Fourier analysis using Fourier transforms or Fourier series.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have to distinguish chaotic processes from random processes. Chaotic processes are deterministic, and stochastic processes are random processes. Chaotic processes are investigated by mathematicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, sociologists, meteorologists, astrophysicists, information theory and neuroscience. In all these branches of science, there are deterministic models exhibiting chaotic properties. Thousands of works on chaotic systems have been published since the 1960s. Mathematicians say that almost all dynamical systems are chaotic, and only a small part of all systems do not show this property. Mathematicians argue that the phase space of the system modeled by the autonomous system of differential equations must be at least 3-dimensional in order to observe chaotic behabior. For discrete systems, there are no such limitations: one recursive equation $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ can also show chaotic properties.\n",

It was Edward Lorenz, a mathematician and American meteorologist who analyzed one of the simplest models to predict weather. It is with his name associated  the \"butterfly effect\" illustrating the extraordinary sensitivity of dynamics to initial conditions: can the butterfly movement in Brazil cause a tornado in Texas.   In this pictorial saying, the essence of chaos is contained: The butterfly disturbs the air movement locally through its flight. This disturbed air movement increases and causes more and more large weather changes, radically changes the \"trajectory\" leading to a tornado that will appear over Texas. Can a butterfly actually be so dangerous?\n",
